This is a CleverScript pre-compiler module for hitchBOT.
The purpose of this module is to translate a tab-separated file that is ready
for input to CleverScript, and parse that file into a language model.
The language model output by this module consists of all of the possible
input combinations as defined by the tab-separated input file.
